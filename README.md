# Fun Calculator üéâ

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator!** This is a beginner-friendly Python script that lets users add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers interactively right from the command line. The program supports both whole numbers and decimals, making your calculations fancy and flexible!

## Features

- **Addition** ‚ûï: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction** ‚ûñ: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication** ‚úñÔ∏è: Multiplies the two numbers.
- **Division** ‚ûó: Divides the first number by the second (be careful with zero!).

## How It Works

1. **User Input:**  
   You will be prompted to enter a first number and a second number. The inputs use `float()` to allow entry of decimal values for greater flexibility.

2. **Math Operations:**  
   The calculator will automatically compute and display:
   - The **sum** of the two numbers
   - The **difference** (first minus second)
   - The **product**
   - The **quotient** (first divided by second)

3. **Output:**  
   The results for all four operations are printed cleanly, so you get the full arithmetic picture in one go!

## Example Usage

```
Enter the first number: 5.5
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 7.5
Difference: 3.5
Product: 11.0
Quotient: 2.75
```

## Installation & Running

1. **Copy the Script:**  
   Copy the Python code into a `.py` file (e.g., `fun_calculator.py`).

2. **Run the Calculator:**  
   Open your terminal (command prompt or shell), navigate to the script location, and run:
   ```
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```

3. **Follow Prompts:**  
   Enter two numbers as instructed.

## Notes

- Uses `float()` for inputs so you can calculate with **decimals**.
- Does *not* perform error handling for division by zero, so make sure your second number isn't zero when dividing (or add a check if you'd like!).
- The script keeps things simple and fun, ideal for **beginners learning Python**[3][5][7].

## Customization Ideas

- Add checks to prevent division by zero and handle invalid inputs.
- Let the user select which operation(s) to perform.
- Loop the calculator for multiple calculations until the user decides to exit.

Happy calculating! üòéüíª
